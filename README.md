# gowin-ddr3-phy-seq-only

Port of Brian's SEQ ONLY code to the Gowin architecture, with lots of completely essential help from Brian himself. Still a WIP

 - Needs further verification in ModelSim, been back-porting changes into the main BrianHG_DDR3 controller to simulate, would be nice to have it use its own simulation
 - Still untested in hardware
